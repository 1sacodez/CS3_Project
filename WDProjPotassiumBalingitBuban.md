#Project Proposal

1. A working website Title. The title should be short, catchy and would encapsulate what the website is about.  This title will be used on the website browser tab.

2. A second title could be used to emphasize the importance of the website.

3. A logo for your website should also be designed. To be used in every page of the website and on the web browser tab (the favicon/icon)

4. A short but comprehensive description of the website using only one or two paragraphs.  This will be used as part of the homepage content of your website.

5. An outline of the website of at least 5 web pages.  Each outline should have a subtitle (Example: Home, Players, About Us, etc) The website should have a clear home page.  The outline should be descriptive and refrain from using Page 1, Page 2 or Link 1, Link 2.  The outline will be translated as the webpages of your website.

6. A description on how JS will be incorporated in your website or on one of the webpages.  It must clearly state where it will be used or found on the website.

7. An initial wireframe or mock-up for all the proposed webpages, showing clearly the layout, position of contents (text, images and media files), and the navigation between web pages.  The wireframe should also clearly show actual web pagesâ€™ titles and the section headers.  

8. Navigation design should allow users to switch between pages with ease from any of the pages.

9. Lastly, include a footer in your wireframe for copyright notices, source citations and Social Media Links using well known image sprites

10. The project proposal containing above information should be saved as a readme.md inside a Github project repository maintained by members of the pair.  The project team name should be WDProjSectionLastNames.
