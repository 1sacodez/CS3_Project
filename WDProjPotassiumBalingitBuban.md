<u> Description on how JS will be incorporated in our website: </u>

    As our website is a quiz/game-style one, every question is to have a correct answer, and every answer should be counted of a point. We envision that JS will be incorporated as the game progresses, counting the number of right or wrong answers of the player. Once the game is finished, it will tally and summarize the results, with every range of values/percentages also having an assigned and equivalent text result. And in the end, the player should be able to truly answer, how well really do they know that Minion?
